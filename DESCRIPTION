Description: Implemented here are procedures for fitting hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLM). It can be used for linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models with random effects for a variety of links and a variety of distributions for both the outcomes and the random effects. Fixed effects can also be fitted in the dispersion part of the mean model.
